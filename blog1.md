# The Silence Between the Stars

I never imagined how profound silence could be until I drifted through the void of deep space, with nothing but the hum of my ship’s life-support systems and the faint starlight outside. Back on Earth, silence isn’t silence at all—there’s the hush of the wind, the chime of distant voices, the invisible orchestra of the living world. Out here, it’s truly silent. The emptiness can rattle your bones if you let it.

Most days, I watch the glow of distant suns drifting by, each one a promise of something new, each one holding the possibility of life or mystery. It’s hard not to wonder who or what might be out there, drifting like me or anchored to some hidden planet’s soil. It’s a strangely comforting thought—the universe is vast, but maybe I’m not truly alone.

This morning—my shipboard morning, at least—I reached the outer edges of the Livia System. It’s an uncharted region as far as Earth’s explorers are concerned. My scanners picked up a series of irregular signals near the third planet, possibly artificial. Could it be the first sign of extraterrestrial technology I’ve encountered, or just a glitch in the system? My excitement is high, but caution tugs at me. Space has taught me that the most promising leads often turn into the most perplexing dead ends.

I’ve promised myself that if I do find something—be it ruins of an ancient civilization or a brand-new lifeform—humanity must know. It would prove that we are not alone. But sometimes, I admit, I fear the discovery itself. If I uncover a new presence in the universe, would it be friend or foe? Or something entirely beyond our comprehension?

For now, it’s just me, the stars, and the next planet on my list. The journey continues, and so do the questions. In the silence between the stars, I’ll keep searching.
