# A World of Copper Skies

I touched down on a planet I’ve designated Toba-4, a rocky world with a thin atmosphere tinted by coppery clouds. The sunset here—it’s something to behold. In place of the familiar blues and purples of Earth, the sky transitions through shades of bronze and dark saffron. It’s both unsettling and mesmerizing.

The terrain is harsh: jagged rocks, dusty ridges, and patches of strange vegetation that look like twisted, pale vines. My scanners indicate they’re absorbing the faint ultraviolet light from the star Toba and releasing a slow, pulsing glow in the evenings. Seeing this glow spread across the horizon reminds me of a city’s lights at night—except these are plants, and there’s no city here. In fact, as far as I can tell, there’s no animal life at all.

I spent yesterday constructing a temporary research shelter, little more than an inflatable habitat tethered against the planet’s gusty winds. As I write this, my instruments are gathering data on the plant life’s unique bioluminescence. I can’t help but think of the many times I camped as a child back on Earth—popping open the tent, lying awake, and listening to the rustle of leaves. Out here, there’s no hum of insects, no chatter of distant wildlife. Just the low moan of the wind over stone.

Despite the solitude, I find these moments sublime. This planet is an untouched stage, its silent grandeur both freeing and intimidating. It’s a bizarre mixture of emptiness and subtle vibrance, like an alien work of art come to life. And there’s something about being the only human here—knowing that I carry every one of my species’ stories, lessons, and hopes in this single vantage point.

I collected soil samples today to analyze in my micro-lab. Over the next few days, I’ll gather more data and decide whether this world is worth a more permanent outpost. My mind churns with the possibilities—could Earth plants ever grow here? Could this place one day be a home, or is it destined to be only a stopover for wandering explorers like me?

I don’t know if I’ll stay on Toba-4 long. The next star system beckons with its own mysteries. Yet before I depart, I’ll make sure to capture as much information as I can. Perhaps one day, another traveler will land here, guided by my records, and see these copper skies the way I do.
